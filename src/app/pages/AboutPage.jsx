          We made this website to help boilermakers through the daily struggle
          of deciding where to eat. Use this website to rate your favorite
          dishes and see what's trending on campus!

          We want to create an all-encompassing food hub for Purdue students
          that would be completely driven by students feedback. We hope that you
          never have to eat a bad meal again. Feel free to reach out to
          adoiphod@purdue.edu or mahesh43@purdue.edu for feedback and
          suggestions of features we should implement.
