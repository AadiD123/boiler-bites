          We made this website to help boilermakers answer the daily struggle of
          deciding where to eat. Rate your favorite dishes and see what's
          trending on campus!

          We want to create all encompassing food hub for Purdue students that
          would be completely driven by students feedback. We hope that you
          never have to eat a bad meal again. Reach out to adoiphod@purdue.edu
          or mahesh43@purdue.edu for feedback and suggestions of features we
          should implement.
